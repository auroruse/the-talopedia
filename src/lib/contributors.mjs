/**
 * Who has written what, taken from the byline every article already carries.
 *
 * An article credits a nation, or several for a communal one, through `authors` or
 * `nation` in its frontmatter, and the site prints that at the top of the page. That
 * is the attribution counted here. Reading it out of the commit log instead measured
 * who last touched a file, which is a different thing: a three-line fix was enough to
 * take an article off the person who wrote it.
 *
 * A communal article counts once for each nation credited. There is no way to say who
 * wrote which half, and the byline does not claim to.
