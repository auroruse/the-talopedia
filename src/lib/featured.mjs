/**
 * The article on the front page today.
 *
 * The pick is a function of the date, so every reader sees the same one all day and
 * it changes at midnight UTC without anybody editing the front page. Each article
 * that qualifies draws its own number for the day, a hash of the date and its name,
 * and the highest wins. It used to be one number taken modulo the whole list, so any
 * page added shifted the pick; now a page joining or leaving moves it only by being
 * the winner, and a page written today first joins the draw tomorrow.
 *
 * An article qualifies when it has both halves of the panel: a sidebar picture and an
 * overview to quote. Roughly ten of the shorter ones do not, and they are skipped
 * rather than shown as a heading over nothing.
